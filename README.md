Races
Elves
Amidst the world's magical chaos, the elves bear a poignant burden. Their once graceful features now mutate, reddening and sharpening, marking them as poignant symbols of a destabilized realm. Their intrinsic bond with magic means their aging is hastened by growing power, a cruel paradox that makes their time both potent and fleeting. Desperation has driven many to the brink, with some turning to the dark allure of forbidden magics in hopes of salvation. But this very desperation has torn their communities apart, creating factions and rifts in a once-unified race. Even their rich tapestry of history, art, and lore is under threat, with many scrambling to protect the echoes of their past. Yet, even in decline, their wisdom remains a beacon, as other races still seek their counsel in these dire times.
Optional Aspects & Stunt (pick one or make your own)
Keeper of the old ways
Stunt: Long Lived Experience - Gain +2 on Lore rolls related to ancient knowledge or history.
Grace Twisted by Chaos
Stunt: Ethereal Solace - When performing a physical or magical task, you may call upon the chaotic magic flowing in your body to gain +1 to the needed skill. Whether you succeed or fail you must make then roll Will and get Fair (+2) or better or take 2 shifts of physical or mental damage.
Dabbling with dark magic
Stunt: Forbidden Power Surge - Once per session, when casting any spell, tap into dark magic to gain +3 to Control Magic. A side effect will be determined by the GM, but it can’t cause physical harm to the caster.
Dwarves
In the aftermath of magical upheaval, dwarves find themselves uniquely positioned amidst the chaos. While their revered runic magic has become unpredictable—some artifacts unleashing volatile energy, others going dormant—their innate connection to the earth grants them a degree of stability unseen in other races. This has led many to view dwarven mountain holds as safe havens against the world's tumult (although only those that did not depend too much on magic). As the unpredictable nature of magic makes many magical items unreliable, dwarven craftsmanship, focusing on non-magical quality and durability, is in high demand. Retreating further into their traditions, dwarves emphasize their roles as artisans and bastions of stability, making their enclaves crucial hubs in a fractured world. Their potential resistance to magical mutations might also place them as mediators in a world on the brink.
Optional Aspects & Stunts (pick one or make your own)
Welcome to All
Stunt: Egalitarian - Gain +1 on Alliances, Empathy, and Rapport for non-combat interactions involving humans, elves, half-elves, and half-orcs.
The Mountains are for the Dwarves
Stunt: Make the Mountains Great Again! - Gain +2 on Provoke rolls for interactions involving non-dwarves.
Mine Craft is the Best Craft
Stunt: Dwarven DIY - When you gain this stunt, also select two crafting materials (e.g., metal, stone, wood). Once per session, you gain +3 on Craft rolls involving either of those materials.
Humans
In this chaotic epoch, humanity's adaptability becomes both a curse and a blessing. Their societies, not intrinsically bound to magic like the elves nor as insulated as the dwarves, are a kaleidoscope of change. Some communities have sought solace by aligning with the dwarven enclaves, while others have embraced a nomadic lifestyle, constantly moving in search of stability. The innate resilience of humans sees them adopting a plethora of roles, from merchants capitalizing on the high demand for non-magical items to scholars seeking understanding of the cataclysm. Their lack of specialized magic or characteristics renders them the canvas on which the world's changes are most vividly painted.
Optional Aspects & Stunts (pick one or make your own)
Strength in Community
Stunt: Talk it Out - Once per session, gain +2 to a non-combat roll involving conversation.
Tenacious in a Corner
Stunt: “This is me surviving” - Once per session, gain +2 to Scavenging, Athletics, Deceive, Will, or Stealth for a roll in a desperate situation.
Canvas of Adaptation
Stunt: Jack of All Trades - Once per session, you can choose to gain a +2 bonus to any skill roll that you have as Mediocre (+0).
Half-Elves
Torn between two worlds, half-elves have always grappled with duality. Now, with the cataclysm’s impact, their unique heritage becomes both a blessing and a curse. On one hand, the magic in their veins makes them susceptible to the same changes the elves undergo, yet their human side provides a resilience, allowing them to adapt to the changing world more effectively. Half-elves, more than anyone, represent a bridge between the old world and the new.
Aspects
Caught Between Grace and Grit: Their blend of elven magic and human resilience.
Harmonizing Dual Blood: Balancing their elven heritage with their human side.
Ambassadors of Two Worlds: Their unique position to bridge the gap between elves and humans.
Optional Aspects & Stunts
Suppress the change
Stunt: Mystic Dampening - Once per session, reduce the effects of a single magical in attack or influence, making it less potent.
Make the new world your own
Stunt: Adaptive Mind - You may consider your mental stress boxes to each be increased by 1 when it involves magical instability.
Harmonizer of Dual Bloodlines
Stunt: Diplomatic Insight - Gain a +2 to Empathy or Rapport rolls when attempting to mediate conflicts or foster alliances between diverse groups.
Half-Orcs
The cataclysm has affected everyone, but for half-orcs, it presents a unique opportunity. Their inherent strength and tenacity make them formidable in a destabilized world. Often shunned by both orcs and humans in the past, they now find themselves in a position where their duality can be their greatest asset. Some half-orcs seek acceptance and collaboration, while others see this as the dawn of a new era where they can carve out their own destinies.
Aspects
Might in the Midst of Mutation: Their physical strength in the face of the cataclysm.
Dual Blood's Dawn: Seeing their mixed heritage as an advantage in the new era.
Destiny’s Own Forging: Carving their path in the destabilized world.
Optional Aspects & Stunts

Orcish Battle Fury
Stunt: Orcish Onslaught - Once per session, in a fight that you started, unleash your orcish fury to make a powerful attack, gaining a +2 and striking two adjacent opponents.
Classes
Barbarian
Barbarian tribes have been dramatically affected by the cataclysm. The strengthening of magical creatures in the world have driven many barbarians from the wild to live among what remains of civilization. Only the hardiest of tribes continue to live in the desolate wastelands beyond, seeking for a way to coexist with an increasingly hostile world.
Stunt: Rage - After taking a physical consequence, for the rest of the scene you get +1 to all physical rolls and -1 for all other rolls. This effect can stack if multiple consequences are taken in the same scene.
Tribal status: Select a status for the tribe your barbarian is from. The options are Extinct, Endangered, and Refugees. Select an aspect and associated stunt for your barbarian depending on your choice (shown in next section), or create your own.
Bard
The artistic talents of bards has always been somewhat magical, but it has erupted since the cataclysm. Some bards read poems that bring crowds to tears and lamentations on what the world has lost. Others play ballads that drive armies into a berserker rage. Bards offer a glimmer of light or a weight of purpose that drives away the despair so many are feeling. The talents of bards have driven them into leadership and support roles undreamt of in the old world.
Performative magic: Use music, dance, or poetry to cast spells and inspire allies based on your chosen focus (see Bard Spells section for more details).
Craft new songs/spells: Choose one skill that is the core of your performative talent. Once per scenario you may craft a new magical song/performance. Choose an aspect and stunt below or create your based on one of these stills or a different one.
Power to sway the heart
Stunt: Writer of Odes and Laments - Once per scenario, you may use Empathy to craft a new magical song.
Rockstar of the waste
Stunt: Writer of Anthems - Once per scenario, you may use Rapport to craft a new magical song.
Echoes of a Lost Era
Stunt: Writer of Ballads -  Once per scenario, you may use Lore to craft a new magical song.
Cleric
Holy magics were essentially unaffected by the cataclysm. The role of clerics as healers has never been more needed. Few clerics have time for adventuring. Most have either joined the New Dawn (the united paladin order), or have been conscripted into the service of other large populations. There are also some who have sensed a growing use of dark magics, and are cautiously investigating it before it can take hold. There are also a few who have gone the opposite way, and have found a new and twisted hope in dark magic, which was also unaffected by the cataclysm.
Holy (or unholy) magic: Harness holy (or unholy)  power for healing, protection, and smiting foes. First, choose what type of cleric you will be. The choices are Holy Code Adherent, Righteous Rejector of the Holy Code, or Cleric of the Dark. A set of spells will be available to you depending on your choice. See the next section for more details.
Druid
Changes in the world have had an extreme effect on the druids. Their shape shifting abilities are now extremely powerful and unpredictable. The increasing desolation of the world has led druids to begin to have physical traits to reflect this, such as rashes, reddening skin, and gray patches. Some druids are seeking for ways to heal the world, or understand what is happening to it. Some blame scholarly magic for the end of the world and seek to hunt down and destroy wizards, sorcerers, and all forms of magic users to stop them from further destabilizing nature. Some have accepted the changing of the world and enjoy their expanding abilities, seeking to shapeshift into ever more powerful forms.
Aspects

Mutation's Marked
Wild Heart in a Fractured World

Shapeshifting: Transform into animals, gaining their abilities. 
Communion with nature: Communicate and harness the natural world.
Fighter
For fighters, the cataclysm has provided unprecedented opportunities for work. Their non magical status has led to their being one of the most trusted professions around. However, the increased power of magic users has forced fighters to approach any potentially magic conflict with extreme caution. Many fighters scour the land for magical weapons in an effort to even the odds against hated magical foes. Some fighters see this period of history as an unprecedented opportunity for glory and renown. Some other grizzled warriors have lost all that they loved in life, so they now live only to test their mettle against the horrible creatures that now prowl the land.
Weapon specialization: Select up to two combat tools to have mastery in. Gain +1 to Fight or Shoot while using those weapons in combat.
Examples for Fighter builds with an associated aspect and stunt are shown in the next section.
Paladin
Despite holy magic being untouched by the cataclysm, the horrors accompanied by the collapse of civilization have taken a heavy toll on the paladins’ desire to live lives of uncompromising honor and righteousness. A council representing all paladins was convened 5 years ago that attempted to unite the teachings of all paladin orders and religious traditions into a single code of ethics, called the Holy Code of the New Dawn. Nearly all paladins have rallied under the banner of the New Dawn, a nation state that will serve as a protectorate of the innocent and a bastion of holy magic. This renewed purpose binds them together, though internal conflicts about the means to achieve their goals are common. Followers of the New Dawn have scoured the land to gather the weak and defenseless, especially children, bringing them to their new nation. They are also relentless dispensers of justice, pitilessly crushing those they deem too far gone to save. Some paladins have accepted the Holy Code, but they attribute most of the evils since the cataclysm to the actions of desperate people pushed to the limit, and that they should instead be redeemed and converted. They eschew the New Dawn, instead traveling the waste preaching the Holy Code and acting without violence except as a last resort. A few paladins find the formation of a single Holy Code to be the height of arrogance. They will rarely call themselves paladins because of the association with the New Dawn, yet they still seek to follow the codes they once held, traveling the waste and seeking to purge the taint of black magic they have begun to sense.
Sacred oath: Their commitment to a sacred cause allows them to draw power from it, bolstering them in the heat of battle or protecting their allies.
Stunt: Oathbound - Create a sacred oath that your Paladin will strive to adhere to. Gain +1 for any roll for actions that intentionally serve that oath, and -1 for actions that knowingly run contrary to it. 
Work with the GM to make sure your oath is not overbroad or too niche.
Holy magic Similar to Clerics, but more martially focused. (Choose whether your paladin will be an adherent of the Holy Code or not.)
Ranger
The rangers, always attuned to the balance of nature, now walk a world askew. Their role as stewards and hunters becomes paramount as beasts mutate and terrains shift unpredictably. With cities becoming insular, rangers are often the vital links between isolated communities, using their unparalleled navigation skills to guide the lost and deliver critical news or supplies.
Marshal of the Wild: Rangers have earned the respect of many of the beasts that prowl the wilderness. Animals that are bonded to a ranger may aid in combat, reconnaissance, etc. The animals that typically join the ranger are shown in the next section.
Stunt: Animal companion - Whenever you have a skill become Great, you are joined by a new animal companion associated with that skill. Though you do not control the animal, it will usually try to follow your directions, especially when the requested task goes with the associated skill.
Sorcerer
With the cataclysm skewing the balance of magic, sorcerers, who channel raw arcane energy, often find themselves at the center of this change. The unpredictability of their magic has heightened, turning some into ticking arcane bombs, while others harness this volatility, becoming masters of their own unpredictable domain. They must actively hide their power from those who blame them for the world’s destruction, or brandish it with enough strength that their enemies cower with fear.
Aspects
Wild Magic Personified
Arcane Anomaly
Tempestuous Power
Abilities & Powers
Spellcasting: Harness innate magic, often tied to their ancestry or a unique event. (select two spells from each of the sorcerer spell groups: Elemental Surge, Mystic Forces, and Bloodline’s Call; six spells total)
Warlock
Warlocks have always been defined by the pacts they forge with powerful entities. However, since the cataclysm, many of these connections have been severed, leaving warlocks in a state of loss and vulnerability. Now, the only remaining links they can form are with the mysterious immortals. This unique connection has transformed the warlocks' role in society; some become desperate seekers, trying to understand these elusive beings, while others wield their new-found powers with authority, representing the interests of these ageless entities.
Spellcasting: Draw power from a pact with a powerful entity. Select a patron from the next section and gain all associated spells.
Bound by Otherworldly Ties
Stunt: Magical endowment - You gain +1 to Control Magic wherever you are casting spells that directly help further the goals of your patron.
Wizard
Hated and feared by those who blame them for the destruction of the world, wizards have become scattered islands of power. The scholarly mages, wizards once held extensive arcane knowledge. But now, with the world changed, much of their knowledge is either obsolete or dangerously outdated. Some seek to restore the past's knowledge, while others wish to forge ahead, documenting the new world's arcane mysteries. 
Aspects

Frostfire Fox: A fox whose fur transitions from icy blue to fiery red. It can exude cold or warmth in a controlled radius, affecting its environment.

Ranger Animal Companions
If you wish, your animal companion can be determined based on the skill you select to be “Great” when creating your character. The animal and the skill it is associated with are listed below. The only companions for which this skill match is absolutely mandatory are the magical ones (unicorn, phoenix, stag).
Fox (Deceive)
Aspect: Cunning Trickster
Usefulness: Excellent at creating distractions and misleading enemies.
Stunt: Sly Escape - Once per session, create a distraction to gain an advantage in positioning or to escape a situation.
Unicorn (Empathy)
Aspect: Beacon of Purity
Usefulness: Can heal and cleanse, as well as bolster the morale of allies. Note that a unicorn is extremely ostentatious and important in this world. Its magic is mostly holy, so it is largely (but not entirely) unaffected by the instability of magic. It also chose you for a reason. If you have this companion, it will likely end up defining your character’s life, and possibly the entire campaign.
Stunt: Purifying Touch - Heal a severe wound or cleanse an ailment once per session.
Wolf (Fight)
